Introduction
============

This is a command line utility which reads in a Photoshop file and
outputs its layer layout as a text, JSON, or XML data.

This is still WORK IN PROGRESS.


Roadmap
=======

* review and document all source code
* create actual command line interface with different options
* tidy up the Makefile (it's been written by hand, very poorly indeed)
* provide more detailed documentation on adding new features
* cover as many platforms as possible
