Introduction
============

This is a command line utility which reads in a Photoshop file and
outputs its layer layout as a text, JSON, or XML data.

Tested on the following platforms (lits to be updated soon):

* Mac OS X
* Win XP (you will need mingw32 and cygwin/msys to compile)

This is still WORK IN PROGRESS.


Roadmap
=======

* provide more detailed documentation on adding new features
* cover as many platforms as possible
