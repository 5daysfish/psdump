Introduction
============

This is a command line utility which reads in a Photoshop file and
outputs its layer layout as a text, JSON, or XML data.

To parse Photoshop files `libpsd` is used. Its source code is
included. You can also download it separately from
[SourceForge.net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpsd/ "libpsd page
at SourceForge.net").

Tested on the following platforms:

* Mac OS X
* Win XP (requires mingw32 with cygwin/msys OR MS Visual Studio 9+)

This is still WORK IN PROGRESS.


Roadmap
=======

* provide more detailed documentation on adding new features
* cover as many platforms as possible
